## Project assignment - API

This repo contains the API part of the assignment. It uses MongoDB as a database. Express is also used to handle request from clients. The database is documented-oriented and will save Workouts and Exercises in seperate collections. A workout is later populated by Exercises chosen by the user.

The Client repo for this assignment can be found here:
